			<p class="post">These websites, <a href="http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~corythoma/">http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~corythoma/</a>, <a href="https://panos.cs.pitt.edu/">https://panos.cs.pitt.edu/</a>, and <a href="http://www.wdwinfo.com/chat.htm">http://www.wdwinfo.com/chat.htm</a>, ranged from above average, very good, to downright being an assault on the eyes. The first website of the bunch was a personal webpage for Cory Thoma. The links functioned mostly how someone would expect them to. The links to documents opened up a pdf in another tab, and behaved as expected. The links that surprised me were the navigation panel up at the top of the screen. Instead of linking to a separate webpage like every other link on the page, they instead automatically scrolled the page to the matching section. Navigating the website was clean and seamless. The webpage was small enough that a simple manual scroll would allow a user to locate what they wished to find, although a search bar would have been appreciated by users looking for something specific. The purpose of the site was to highlight and provide examples of Cory Thoma’s various professional achievements, and the site does a great job of making that clear. The overly bright green color clashes with the rest of the content and the center of the site seems a bit too crowded with information. Overall, not a bad site by any means, but one where repeated use or reading of multiple articles would become frustrating.<br>
			The panos site contains links, that again, are mostly logical. They lead to pages one would expect, but the top bar again serves as a navigation pane of sorts, leading to different parts of the same webpage rather than a new web page. The webpage serves the same purpose as the first site; the page promotes an individual’s educational and professional accomplishments in an attempt to advertise their qualifications. Thanks to the design of the site and its aethstetic focused on cooler colors, the panos site does its job more effectively than its predecessor. Informaiton has room to breathe and there are clearly deliniated sections. These sections can blend into one another at times because of the colors chosen being similar to one another, but a little extra looking is enough to dispell confusion. The animations featured between sections and when interacting with certain objects posed a minor annoyance as they delayed access to information, but overall the site was a joy to use.<br>
			Sadly, the final site does not fair so well in the criticism department. The site felt far too shady for me to follow the links, even with the knowledge of it being safe since it was an assignment. Navigation was mediocre at best, and really hampered the site’s goal of selling Disney vacations. The aethstetic was a nightmarish mess. Horrible and wierdly designed, the site gave off a 2003 webpage vibe, and suffered from too much information at every turn. The color scheme was inconsistent from page to page. The aethstetic and poor navigation made the page frustrating to look at and made the site seem too shady to encourage prolonged interaction, much less any type of financial transaction.

			<p class="post">The website <a href="https://www.columbiagaspa.com/">https://www.columbiagaspa.com/</a> violates several of the ten design principles discussed in Smashing Magazine’s “10 Principles of Effective Web Design” (<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/10-principles-of-effective-web-design/">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/10-principles-of-effective-web-design/</a>). First and foremost, it violates principle 1: Don’t make users think. Upon visiting this page, I immediately developed numerous questions, ranging from inquiries about the top navigation tab, to wondering why one particular link at the top of the page was randomly in Spanish and included a question mark. The page certainly tests user’s  patience. While login looked fairly standard, the registration page included three multi-part steps. There was the conventional “required” asterick next to every field, which made me wonder why they would include it in the first place. Everything on the page vies for your attention. The contrasting blue and yellow navigation bar catches your eye, but the images linking to articles and pages constantly serve as a distraction. The page is terrified of white space. There is either text, an image, a border, or a button on every part of the page and it makes grouping separate items on the page extremely difficult. Most of the page seems to be dedicated to pushing various news articles on the user, rather than the potential features of the page. I saw a bill paying service, and the potential for emergency gas leak reporting, but these features were not highlighted by any definition. The writing was commanding and abrasive, the design was more complex than what the page needed, and all of these aspects combined to make an unenjoyable web experience. The page may have all of the information and features required from a technical perspective, but the shoddy and haphazard design robs the page of its potential effectiveness.</p>
